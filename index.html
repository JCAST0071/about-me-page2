  <p> 
    I Initially began by declaring my major in Computer Science
    but after taking the intro classes I quickly realized that,
    this subject was not something I was enjoying.
    </p>
    <p>
        I chose to switch to cybersecurity through a<br>
        particular lesson I had in one of my Informatin Systems class.<br>
        In this class we had one section that touched on security and networks.
        We had a teacher come in and demonstrate <br> 
        he could easily take control of a <br>
        device that was vulnerable through a bluetooth network. 
        He also explained why security in computers and networks is a crucial 
        importance in the technology field.

    <!--personal idol-->
    <p> A big influnce for me came from seven time Mr. Olympia Arnold Swaznegger. 
    I watched a lot of his videos to help me<br> create a workout routine
    one thing I learned from him is that you have to workout with intensity in order to grow.</p>

    <h2> Religion</h2>
    <p> For my first few years of age, My family was catholic. We lived in Mexico and 
        with my fathers side of the family. But when we moved to the United States, we became more active
        in the LDS church because my mother was already a member.
